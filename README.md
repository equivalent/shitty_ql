# ShittyQl

[ShittyQl](https://github.com/equivalent/shitty_ql) simple gem for building constructive JSON API using GET requests.


It's more a pragmatic tool and philosophy of how to write JSON API where
Frontend constructs what data it needs using GET query

So the gem tries to do what GraphQL for obtaining data but obviously gem is more :hankey:


Example of API endpoints

`GET /accounts?include=account.name,account.books`
`GET /accounts?include=account.name,account.books.page.2`
`GET /accounts?include=account.name,account.books.page.2.limit.10`
`GET /accounts?include=account.name,account.books.page.2,account.books.limit.10`
`GET /accounts?include=account.name,account.books.page.2,account.books.limit.10,accounts.books.order.desc`
